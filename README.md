# Increment String

Write a function which increments a number at the end of the string, and returns it as a new string. 
    If the string ends with a number, the number must be incremented by 1. 
    If the string does not end with a number the number 1 should be appended to the new string.  

If the number has leading zeros the amount of digits should be considered.


#### Examples

   ```
   abc >>> abc1

    abcxyz23 >>> abcxyz24

    asd0042 >>> asd0043

    asd9 >>> asd10
```
